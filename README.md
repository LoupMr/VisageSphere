# üåÄ VisageSphere ‚Äî AI-Powered Face Recognition & Online Presence Search Engine

![VisageSphere Banner](./logo.png)

## üåü Introduction

**VisageSphere** is a cutting-edge educational and research-oriented side project dedicated to exploring the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Face Recognition, Computer Vision, and Real-time Web Data Integration. This project allows users to upload or capture a photo, livestream, or recorded video and instantly identifies faces, searching the open web in real-time to retrieve publicly accessible information like social media profiles and other public mentions.

Built purely for educational and research purposes, VisageSphere demonstrates the fascinating intersection between face recognition technologies and open-source intelligence (OSINT).
